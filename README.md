# Chegg Question Poster Script

This script automates the process of posting a question on Chegg. It retrieves cookies from a JSON file, uploads a local image, and creates a question post.

**Requirements:**

* PHP
* CURL library

**Instructions:**

1. Save the script as `chegg_poster.php`.
2. Replace `cookieschegg.json` with the path to your Chegg cookies file (obtain cookies responsibly).
3. Configure the script variables like `$subjectId` and `$file_local_full` (path to your image).
4. Run the script: `php chegg_poster.php`

**Note:**

* This script might violate Chegg's terms of service. Use it responsibly and at your own risk.
* The script functionality might rely on the current Chegg website structure and may break in the future.

**Disclaimer:**

I cannot guarantee the functionality or safety of this script. It's recommended to understand the code and Chegg's terms of service before using it.
